# My personal portfolio website

- current working version is built with HTML and CSS/SASS
- built using the desktop-first approach and is 'fully' responsive
- best viewed on a 1800px screen using Google Chrome but smaller screens are okay too :D

### TODO:
[] add JavaScript
[] add portfolio section
[] refactor...
[] add feature supports for cross browser/version compatibility
